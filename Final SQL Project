For my final SQL project, I pulled together these queries to quantify the information below from the database that was provided to me.

Table database: Chinook, provided by Charlotte Chaze for Break Into Tech

/* List all songs by the group Deep Purple*/
SELECT title, name
FROM chinook.albums
JOIN chinook.artists
ON albums.artistid = artists.artistid
WHERE name = 'Deep Purple'
ORDER BY title;    

/* using Join to find the following information for invoices*/
SELECT invoices.billingaddress, invoices.invoicedate, invoices.total
FROM chinook.invoices
JOIN chinook.invoice_items
ON invoices.invoiceid = invoice_items.invoiceid;              

/* Selecting all tracks where composer is not null */
SELECT *
FROM chinook.tracks
WHERE composer IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY trackid;

/* first name, last name, and company of all custoemrs from USA*/
SELECT DISTINCT country, firstname, lastname, company
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country = 'USA'
ORDER BY country;

/*Listing the first and last name, invoiceid, invoice date, and billing country*/
SELECT customers.firstname, customers.lastname, invoices.invoiceid, invoices.invoicedate, invoices.billingcountry
FROM chinook.customers
JOIN chinook.invoices
ON customers.customerid=invoices.customerid;

/*List all employees who work in IT*/
SELECT employeeid, lastname, firstname, title, phone 
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE title LIKE '%IT%';

/* Finding the track name, album title, media type, and genre*/
SELECT tracks.name AS 'Track Name', albums.title AS 'Album Title', media.name AS 'Media Type', genre.name AS 'Genre Type'
FROM chinook.tracks tracks
JOIN chinook.albums albums ON albums.albumid=tracks.albumid
JOIN chinook.media_types media ON media.mediatypeid=tracks.mediatypeid
JOIN chinook.genres genre ON genre.genreid=tracks.genreid;

/* Updating employee last name*/
UPDATE chinook.employees
SET LastName = 'James' 
WHERE Firstname = 'Nancy';
