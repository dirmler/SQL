#For this project, I downloaded this data set from Kaggle
#Then I created a table to insert the Spotify data
#Finally, I performed analytics on the data

#creating the table
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (

#Then I inserted the spotify data . csv into the table

#Finally, I explored the data in the table

#First I determined the average popularity by the artist and track name
SELECT artist_name, track_name, avg(popularity)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name

#Next I determined which artists appeared on the list at least twice 
SELECT artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY COUNT (artist_name)>2

#Finally I selected all songs by BTS that appeared on the list in order by popularity
SELECT track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
